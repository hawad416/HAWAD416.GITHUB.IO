        <p>
            ü¶ã ÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ ÿπŸÑŸäŸÉŸÖ. (peace be upon you!) hi there! I'm Hawa, and I'm on a mission to make a meaningful impact in the world through the intersection of education, technology, and entrepreneurship.
            As a third-year Computer Science student, I'm fueled by a genuine passion for creating positive change.
             Inspired by my own journey as a first-generation Gambian student and the values instilled in me by my culture and religion, I'm committed to making a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
            üë©üèæ‚Äçüíª my experiences have shaped my path and purpose. 
            as the founder of Tutors of the Smiling Coast, a nonprofit tutoring service, i've provided educational opportunities to students of all backgrounds, in hopes of empowering the next generation.
            i'm also driven to explore the dynamic world of entrepreneurship & technology startups. i am the founder & president of  cseed @ the university of washington, where we are on a mission to increase
            diversity within the entrepreneurial ecosystem. cseed is a technology entrepreneurship organization within the computer science & engineering department,
            connecting students to founders, venture capitalists, & the startup ecosystem through curated panels, discussions, & events.

        </p>

        <p>
            üå≥ outside of my academic pursuits, you'll often find me engaging in thought-provoking conversations with strangers, exploring the beauty of nature through walks, laughing (way too much lol!), resting, and hanging out with friends & family.
             i am on a continuous journey of finding a balance between achievement and self-care, and I encourage others to do the same.
        </p>
        <h3 id="trans">üå™ transparency notice:</h3> 
        <p>
            to my fellow students & friends, 
            i want to address something that we often encounter when browsing 
            profiles and experiences of others‚Äîit's easy to feel inadequate, 
            as if we're falling behind or lacking in some way. we may even wonder
             why it seems like others have it all figured out. 
             but I want to assure you that each of us is on our own distinct path,
             and there is no concept of being behind or ahead. we are exactly where we are meant to be.

            we all have our own unique journey, filled with challenges, sacrifices, and unexpected turns. 
            it's crucial to believe in yourself and stay committed to your goals. 
            in the age of social media and polished profiles, it's tempting to believe that others have perfect lives. 
            
            I want to be fully transparent and let you know that I have faced my fair share of difficulties and setbacks. 
            i've experienced significant personal challenges, financial challenges, have burnout sevaral times to the point where I had to take time away from school, 
            and my academic performance has suffered as a result.

            these are the parts of our journeys that often go unspoken, but it's important to remember that we are not alone. 
            I encourage you to prioritize self-care, seek support when needed. let's create a community where we uplift one another and openly acknowledge the challenges we face.

remember, you are capable, resilient, and deserving of success. embrace your journey, take care of yourself, and know that your time will come!!
